# Jasper JRXML Legacy Skill

Portable Agent Skill for complex **legacy iReport/JasperReports 2.x** reports, especially JasperReports 2.0.4, old DTD-based JRXML, dense official forms, absolute layouts, subreports, and headless `.jrxml` → `.jasper` validation.

It preserves legacy syntax instead of “helpfully” upgrading a 2007 report into a 2026 incident report.

## What it provides

- high-fidelity patterns for numbered fields, boxes, dividers, rotated sidebars, and rounded boxes with an open top;
- an evidence-based workflow for reproducing multi-page official forms;
- a configurable PowerShell/JDK 8 compiler harness using the consuming project's JasperReports 2.x jars;
- official SINAN form and JasperReports reference sources;
- local project learning under `docs/report/`, without leaking proprietary conventions into the shared skill.

## Install

The repository is a portable Agent Skill, a Claude Code marketplace, and a Codex plugin marketplace. Root `SKILL.md` remains the canonical source. The Codex plugin tree is generated from it and must not be edited manually.

### Codex plugin marketplace

Add the GitHub repository as a Codex marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add vitorhugo-dotnet/jasper-jrxml-claude-skill
```

Install the skill-only plugin:

```bash
codex plugin add legacy-jrxml-toolkit@jasper-jrxml-plugins
```

Start a new Codex thread after installation so the skill is loaded.

The installable plugin uses the official layout:

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
plugins/legacy-jrxml-toolkit/
├── .codex-plugin/plugin.json
└── skills/jasper-jrxml/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── references/
    ├── scripts/
    └── docs/
```

### Codex direct skill installation

For a skill-only checkout without plugin metadata, clone the repository into Codex's skill directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorhugo-dotnet/jasper-jrxml-claude-skill.git \
  "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/jasper-jrxml"
```

Restart Codex after installing the skill.

### Claude Code marketplace

Add this GitHub repository as a marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add vitorhugo-dotnet/jasper-jrxml-claude-skill
```

Install the plugin:

```text
/plugin install legacy-jrxml-toolkit@jasper-jrxml-plugins
```

The plugin exposes the skill under the Claude Code namespace:

```text
/legacy-jrxml-toolkit:jasper-jrxml
```

Equivalent non-interactive CLI commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add vitorhugo-dotnet/jasper-jrxml-claude-skill
claude plugin install legacy-jrxml-toolkit@jasper-jrxml-plugins
```

### Claude Code direct checkout

For local development without registering the marketplace, clone the repository and load it as a plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorhugo-dotnet/jasper-jrxml-claude-skill.git
claude --plugin-dir ./jasper-jrxml-claude-skill
```

Inside that session, invoke `/legacy-jrxml-toolkit:jasper-jrxml`. For project-scoped distribution, prefer marketplace installation instead of maintaining another copy.

### Cross-agent path

Clone into the open Agent Skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorhugo-dotnet/jasper-jrxml-claude-skill.git \
  ~/.agents/skills/jasper-jrxml
```

Clients that support the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) can discover it there or through their configured skill catalog.

Do not keep multiple editable copies. Prefer the root skill plus generated packages or symlinks supported by the client and operating system.

## Build distribution artifacts

Generate the portable Agent Skill ZIP and the official Codex plugin ZIP:

```bash
bash scripts/package-skill.sh
```

Artifacts:

```text
dist/jasper-jrxml-skill.zip
dist/jasper-jrxml-skill.zip.sha256
dist/legacy-jrxml-toolkit-codex-plugin.zip
dist/legacy-jrxml-toolkit-codex-plugin.zip.sha256
```

The repository marketplace is the preferred Codex installation path. The ZIPs support release distribution, offline inspection, and environments that expose manual skill/plugin upload.

After changing canonical skill files or public metadata, regenerate the committed Codex plugin tree:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-codex-plugin.py
```

Repository validation fails when the generated tree is stale.

## Usage

Ask the agent to create, edit, inspect, compile, or validate a legacy JRXML report, or invoke `jasper-jrxml` explicitly when the client supports direct skill invocation.

Compile a report with the bundled harness:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/compile-jrxml.ps1 `
  -Jrxml "reports/complex-form.jrxml" `
  -ProjectRoot "C:\path\to\consumer-project" `
  -LibDirectory "target\app\WEB-INF\lib" `
  -DeployDirectory "src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\reports"
```

Requirements:

- JDK 8;
- the consuming project's JasperReports 2.x and transitive jars;
- PowerShell;
- a real application fill/PDF comparison for visual validation.

## Compatibility boundary

This skill intentionally targets old iReport/JasperReports. Current [JasperReports samples](https://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/sample.reference/README.html) are conceptual references only. Never introduce modern syntax into a JasperReports 2.x template without compiling it against the project's exact legacy dependencies.

Official complex-form sources are listed in [`references/official-report-sources.md`](references/official-report-sources.md), including the [SINAN portal](https://portalsinan.saude.gov.br/).

## Project-specific learning

When a correction is confirmed, the agent writes a focused Markdown lesson in the **consuming repository's** `docs/report/`. The distributed skill is not silently modified and private project details are not promoted upstream. See [`docs/report/README.md`](docs/report/README.md).

## Validate this repository

Run all portable skill, Claude plugin, Codex plugin, and package checks:

```bash
bash tests/validate-skill.sh
bash tests/package-skill.Tests.sh
```

Validate with Claude Code itself:

```bash
claude plugin validate . --strict
claude --plugin-dir .
```

Inside that Claude Code session, invoke:

```text
/legacy-jrxml-toolkit:jasper-jrxml
```

If PowerShell is installed:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/compile-jrxml.Tests.ps1
```

## Publishing boundary

This repository can be installed directly as an independent Codex marketplace. Inclusion in any OpenAI-operated curated directory remains subject to OpenAI's current review and submission process; the repository does not claim an undocumented automatic global-listing path.
